# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Middleware

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Express.js related to the use of asynchronous operations within middleware functions.  When an async operation is used in middleware without proper error handling and `next()` call, unexpected behaviors and potential application crashes can occur.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from improper error handling and missing `next()` call in an asynchronous middleware function. If an error occurs within the `async` middleware function, the `next()` function call for handling the error, or the subsequent middleware/route handler, may not be executed, which leads to the route handler never being called.  This can result in a hang or unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Access `/async` endpoint. Observe that it either does not respond or does not respond in a timely manner.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the middleware. The key change is ensuring that `next()` is called in both the success and error cases, ensuring proper flow of control.

## Lessons Learned

Always handle potential errors within `async` middleware functions.  Ensure that the `next()` function is called, regardless of whether the asynchronous operation succeeds or fails.  Proper error handling within middleware is crucial for building robust and reliable Express.js applications.
